<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a page dedicated to me and all my previous coding accomplishments. Hope you enjoy!</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I attend the Saint Ann's school in Downtown Brooklyn and I am currently a rising juinor. The is the first year I have ever tried coding and it's been so fun. I am hoping in my time at Girls Who Code I can make an informal, rough decision on what I major in during college. As of right now, Biology, Journalism, and Computer Engineering are all of key interest to me. I hope you guys enjoy my coding projects and I will try to periodically keep you guys updated with my coding work!</p> 
<h2 style="font-family:courier;">These are some things I have done on Scratch recently!</h2>
