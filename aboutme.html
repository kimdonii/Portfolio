<p style="font-family:Life Savers;">This is a page dedicated to me and all my previous coding accomplishments. Hope you enjoy!</p>
<p style="font-family:Life Savers;">I attend the Saint Ann's school in Downtown Brooklyn and I am currently a rising juinor. The is the first year I have ever tried coding and it's been so fun. I am hoping in my time at Girls Who Code I can make an informal, rough decision on what I major in during college. As of right now, Biology, Journalism, and Computer Engineering are all of key interest to me. I hope you guys enjoy my coding projects and I will try to periodically keep you guys updated with my coding work!</p>
<p style="font-family:Life Savers;"> Fun fact about me: I am an avid painter in paintings that revolve around the topic of black beauty!</p>

<p style="font-family:Life Savers;"> I just recently made a side scroller Scratch game named, Unicorn Dash. The objective of the game is for the user to control the unicorn so it doesnt hit the flying rainbow blocks and the star. Using the keys on your laptop, you fly the unicorn up and down and if you hit the star or the blocks... restart!
